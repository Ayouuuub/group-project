                    <p class="cutoffCard">Le cardio training, également connu sous le nom d'exercice cardiovasculaire, est une forme d'activité physique rythmique qui permet d'augmenter votre fréquence cardiaque dans votre zone cible de fréquence cardiaque. En effet, c'est dans cette zone que votre corps brûle le plus de graisses et de calories. Ce qui différencie le cardio des autres types d'exercices est qu'il se concentre sur la capacité de votre corps à utiliser l'oxygène pendant l'entraînement. La capacité cardio d'une personne peut varier en fonction de plusieurs facteurs tels que la génétique, le sexe et l'âge. Cependant, il est important de souligner que ces facteurs ne doivent pas vous empêcher d'améliorer votre santé cardiovasculaire. Il est possible de développer votre aptitude cardio et d'augmenter votre endurance, même si vous avez des prédispositions génétiques ou si vous êtes d'âge avancé.</p>

                <p class="lessons-cat">STRENGTH TRAINING</p>
                <p class="cutoffCard">Strength training or resistance training involves the performance of physical exercises that are designed to improve strength and endurance. It is often associated with the lifting of weights. It can also incorporate a variety of training techniques such as bodyweight exercises, isometrics, and plyometrics.

                    Training works by progressively increasing the force output of the muscles and uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment. Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity, although circuit training also is a form of aerobic exercise.
                    
                    Strength training can increase muscle, tendon, and ligament strength as well as bone density, metabolism, and the lactate threshold; improve joint and cardiac function; and reduce the risk of injury in athletes and the elderly. For many sports and physical activities, strength training is central or is used as part of their training regimen.</p>

            <p class="lessons-cat">POWER YOGA</p>
            <p class="cutoffCard">Power yoga is a fast-paced cardiovascular workout focused on building strength and flexibility in the body through high-impact yoga postures. The definition of power yoga varies depending on where you practice, but there are some core characteristics that most power yoga classes have in common:

                Strength-building. In power yoga classes, poses can be held for up to a minute, helping to build strength in the targeted muscle group.
                Aerobic workout. Power yoga is typically focused on increasing heart rate and burning calories through a full-body workout and is sometimes referred to as gym yoga.
                A blend of Vinyasa-style poses. At least half of the asanas (postures) in a power yoga class come from Vinyasa yoga sequences, where you link breath to movement.
                Aligns with Ashtanga yoga. Ashtanga yoga is a very specific series of poses that flow together in an ordered sequence. While power yoga is more varied and yoga instructors have the freedom to sequence their classes as they want, many Ashtanga postures are practiced in power yoga classes.</p>

        <p class="cutoffCard">YOGA FOR FITNESS: A YOGA WORKOUT
            While yoga alone can help someone get in shape, this is highly dependent on your current fitness level, the style of yoga, and the intensity or frequency of yoga sessions. 
            
            LAUNCHING A FITNESS LIFESTYLE
            Yoga is a great way to launch a fitness journey, especially if you’re new to exercise or out-of-shape. Yoga activates and exercises every muscle in the body, burning calories and strengthening muscles. Someone new to yoga or exercise may see noticeable changes within weeks, no matter the type or intensity of yoga.</p>

        <p class="lessons-cat">BOXING WORKOUT</p>
        <p class="cutoffCard">Boxing training is a form of exercise that involves footwork, punching, and evasion movements to simulate the activities involved in the sport of boxing.

            It’s often combined with other conditioning activities, such as jumping rope and calisthenics, which increases the intensity of each training session.
            
            Boxing can help improve your heart health, body composition, and strength, as well as lower your blood pressure and aid weight loss.
            
            Most of all, boxing is a fun way to get some exercise and release stress in a safe and healthy way.</p>

        <p class="lessons-cat">PILATES FITNESS</p>
        <p class="cutoffCard">Pilates is a system of exercises using special apparatus, designed to improve physical strength, flexibility, and posture and enhance mental awareness[1]. The method was designed by Joseph Hubertus Pilates from Germany whose father was a Greek ancestry Gymnast and mother was a Neuropath. In his childhood, Pilates was weak and sickly (he suffered from asthma, rickets and rheumatic fever). He strongly needed to take care of his physical health and that is why he became very interested in practicing body building, gymnastics, yoga and ‘kung fu’. At 14 years old he had perfectly developed his musculature and was asked to pose for pictures of anatomical charts.</p>

        <p class="lessons-cat">CROSSFIT</p>
        <p class="cutoffCard">CrossFit describes its concept as ‘constantly varied functional movement at high intensity’ and combines fitness and sociability. If you dislike the isolation of working out alone at the gym but want to improve your strength, conditioning and cardio in the company of like-minded others, then CrossFit might be for you. The very essence of CrossFit is built on fitness camaraderie, achieving the best you can and encouraging others.   

            CrossFit workouts are designed to be full-body – reasonably short, but intense. The mix of exercises will build muscle mass and stamina, and the plyometric exercises, such as burpees or squat jumps, will increase flexibility, speed and improve strength. And there’s no chance of boredom when you’re faced with squats, lunges, cardio machines, kettlebells, medicine balls and even the odd tyre. </p>

        <p class="lessons-cat">BODY COMBAT</p>
        <p class="cutoffCard">here are times when two things look alike, they are usually from the same creator. Not long ago we talked about the benefits of the body pump, and how it was born in the early 90s by Philip Mills and his company Les Mills International. Well, do you know where body combat comes from? Yes, they are correct.

            On this occasion, Mills was not the creator, but the Argentine Nathaniel Leivas, who in the year 2000 produced the first program of the training routine belonging to Les Mills International. Today, the program has reached one hundred countries, recognizing the creators of more than 100.000 qualified monitors around the globe. We can say without fear of being wrong that again from New Zealand they hit the nail on the head.
            
            If we go to a technical definition of what body combat is, we could understand it as a aerobic routine that seeks cardiovascular performance through movements taken from martial arts such as Taekwondo, Tai Chi, Capoeira, Muay Thai, Karate or boxing. Seen this way, we could situate body combat not far from other aerobic routines such as aerobics itself, the aforementioned body pump or fitboxing, which may be closer to you but accompanied by a heavy bag.</p>
